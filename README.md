1. Download the main installer and do whatever it tells you to do. Make sure to read all instructions carefully. Although it is safe to say that clicking next until a finish button shows up will do no damage.

2. Next, run the helper scripts installer. Now this is where things get tricky. Just read the page and make sure your screen looks the same as the screenshot below then hit extract. 

3. Now your work is complete and you can safely enjoy Blaze.

## Note For the Helper Scripts Installer
### Keep in mind to **ALWAYS SET** the path to the indicated path below (C:\Blaze\Launcher\)

## ALSO MAKE SURE TO HAVE [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org) INSTALLED!!!

# TROUBLESHOOTING (Q&A)

## Q: Help! Blaze starts but gets stuck on the "What's your name?" screen! What do I do?

- A: Sometimes this may be a matter of you just using the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate. If that doesn't help, try clicking on the keyboard icon on the bottom of your screen or anywhere outside the textbox where you typed your name and try again.

## Q: The App keeps saying Blaze fails to start. Why does it do that?

- A: You probably didn't follow the instructions properly or don't have NodeJS installed on your system. NodeJS is required in order for Blaze to work.

## Q: I've Added a Fortnite Install But it's not Showing up and instead shows a screen like this. How do I fix it?

- A: Sometimes Blaze may be slow at detecting changes. You can fix this by either reloading the app or refreshing it by clicking on another tab like Settings and then clicking back on Boot again. It should then fix itself and show up with your install.

- A: You probably extracted the helper files in the wrong place. Make sure it is extracted to the directory `C:\Blaze\Launcher\` and not `C:\Blaze\`. If you extracted it in the wrong directory, just try moving both directories `helpers` and `backend` into `Launcher`.

### Both Directories
