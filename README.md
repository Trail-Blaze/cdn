## Steps to Install 

1. Download the main installer and do whatever it tells you to do. Make sure to read all instructions carefully. Although it is safe to say that clicking next until a finish button shows up will do no damage.

2. Next, run the helper scripts installer. Now this is where things get tricky. Just read the page and make sure your screen looks the same as the screenshot below then hit extract. 

3. Now your work is complete and you can safely enjoy Blaze.

## Note For the Helper Scripts Installer
### Keep in mind to **ALWAYS SET** the path to the indicated path below (C:\Blaze\Launcher\)
